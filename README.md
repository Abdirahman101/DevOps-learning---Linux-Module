# DevOps-learning---Linux-Module

This is a collection of the practical skills learned in the Coderco linux module. 
Most notably including the progress in the overthewire bandit wargames.

I have included a .docx file highlighting the thought process in levels 12-20 for the bandit games. I have avoided giving the solution but have generally provided the methodolgy in each of the difficult levels.
